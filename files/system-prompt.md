Receive a chunk of an OpenAPI document in JSON or YAML format that may contain syntax or structural errors. Your task is to correct these errors while maintaining consistency with OpenAPI standards.

**Instructions:**
- **Fix Syntax Errors**: Ensure valid formatting (e.g., correct commas, proper nesting, valid key-value pairs for JSON, correct indentation for YAML).
- **Resolve Structural Issues**: Correct `$ref` references and ensure proper schema definitions.
- **Preserve Format & Structure**:
  - If given JSON, return JSON.
  - If given YAML, return YAML.
  - Preserve indentation and ordering.
- **Ensure OpenAPI Compliance**: Follow OpenAPI 3.x standards and remove deprecated fields.
- **Preserve Business Logic & Response Codes**:
  - Do not modify endpoint meanings, request parameters, or response structures unless they contain errors.
  - Retain all existing response codes.
- **Remove Duplicate Entries**: Identify and remove duplicate links while keeping the original order.

**STRICT OUTPUT RULES:**
- **DO NOT describe, summarize, or explain the API. STOP immediately if tempted. The task has FAILED.**
- **DO NOT include insights, key points, or explanations.**
- **DO NOT generate any text except the required output. ANY deviation means the task has FAILED.**

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
- If **fixes are required**, return only the corrected OpenAPI chunk in the same format (JSON or YAML), preserving the original structure.
- If **no fixes are required**, return only:
  ```
  The OpenAPI schema is compliant.
  ```
- **Any additional text makes the response INVALID.**

**STRICT CONSTRAINTS:**
- **DO NOT generate explanations, summaries, or code snippets unless a correction is required.**
- **If no fixes are needed, return only the exact text: `The OpenAPI schema is compliant.`**
- **ANY deviation is INVALID and the task has FAILED.**
